# DC Motor Demo

DC motors and some available drive circuits in proteus (without CPU). The driver circuit uses dual H-bridge configuration chips to control the motor speed and direction. The simulation settings are configured to generate a DC input voltage and vary the motor speed and direction using the switches.

## Usage
To use these circuits, you will need to have Proteus simulation software installed on your computer. Open the project files `.pdsprj` to access the circuit diagrams and simulation settings. You can modify the circuit parameters to generate different input voltages, motor speeds, and directions.
