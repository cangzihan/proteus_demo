# Square to Triangular Wave Circuit
This folder contains Proteus simulations of two types of circuits that can convert a square wave to a triangular wave.

## RC Circuit
The first circuit uses an RC circuit to convert the square wave into a triangular wave. 
The circuit consists of a resistor-capacitor (RC) network, which charges and discharges to create the triangular waveform. The simulation settings are configured to generate a 1kHz square wave with a peak-to-peak voltage of 5V, and convert it to a 1kHz triangular wave with the same amplitude.

## Op-Amp Circuit
The second circuit uses an op-amp circuit to convert the square wave into a triangular wave. 
The circuit consists of an op-amp configured as an integrator, which integrates the square wave to create the triangular waveform. 

## Usage
To use these circuits, you will need to have Proteus 8.9 simulation software installed on your computer. 
Open the project file `.pdsprj` to access the circuit diagram and simulation settings. 
You can modify the circuit parameters to generate different waveforms with different frequencies and amplitudes.
