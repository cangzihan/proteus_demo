# Signal Circuit Examples in Proteus
ðŸ’¡ This folder contains several example circuits in Proteus simulation software. These circuits demonstrate various concepts and techniques in signal processing, such as amplification, filtering, and sampling.

## Usage
To use these example circuits, you need to have Proteus installed on your computer. 
You can open the corresponding `.pdsprj` file in Proteus 8.9, which contains the complete project with schematic, PCB layout, and simulation settings. 
You can simulate the circuit by running the simulation in Proteus.

## Note
Please note that these example circuits are for educational and reference purposes only. 
Also, note that these circuits do ***not include*** a CPU or any other advanced control components. 
They are purely based on basic analog and digital signal processing techniques.
