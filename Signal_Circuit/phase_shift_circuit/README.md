# Phase Shift Circuit
This project contains three different phase shift circuits implemented in Proteus simulation software. Each circuit demonstrates a different method for shifting the phase of an input signal.

## RC Phase Shift Circuit
The first circuit is based on an RC circuit, consisting of a resistor and capacitor. By changing the ratio of the resistor and capacitor values, the phase shift of the output signal can be adjusted. This circuit provides a simple and low-cost method for phase shifting signals.

## Integrator Phase Shift Circuit
The second circuit is an integrator phase shift circuit. It uses an op-amp to implement an integrator, which can shift the phase of an input signal by up to 90 degrees. This circuit is useful for a range of applications, including audio processing and signal modulation.

## 180 Degree Phase Shift Circuit
The third circuit is a 180-degree phase shift circuit. It is based on an op-amp inverting amplifier circuit, which can invert the input signal and shift its phase by 180 degrees. This circuit is commonly used in audio and signal processing applications.

To use these circuits, you will need to have Proteus 8.9 simulation software installed on your computer. Open the project file `.pdsprj` to access the circuit diagrams and simulation settings.
